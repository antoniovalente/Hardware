IoT AgroIntelligence LoRaWAN Node
=================================

PCB files of a LoRaWAN node for agriculture use. The node uses a
`CubeCell module from Heltec <https://heltec.org/project/htcc-ab01/>`__.
The node has four 12-bit ADC channels, one 18-bit ADC channel, one I2C
port, and one SDI-12 port. It is also possible to connect a 3.6V LiPo
battery and the node has an onboard solar energy management system, that
can directly connect with a 5.5~7V solar panel.
