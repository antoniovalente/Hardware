# IoT AgroIntelligence LoRaWAN Node

PCB files of a LoRaWAN node for agriculture use. The node uses a CubeCell module from Heltec.
The node has four 12-bit ADC channels, one 18-bit ADC channel, one I2C port, and one SDI-12 port.
It is also possible to connect a 3.6V LiPo battery and the node has an onboard solar energy management system, that can directly connect with a 5.5~7V solar panel.
